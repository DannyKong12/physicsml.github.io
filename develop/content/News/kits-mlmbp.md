Summary: KITS Workshop in Machine Learning and Many-Body Physics (Jun. 28 - Jul. 7, 2017)

The Kavli Institute for Theoretical Sciences at the University of Chinese Acadamy of Sciences presents "Machine Learning and Many-Body Physics", a summer school and workshop.  
The central questions addressed in this workshop are "How is machine learning useful for physics/chemistry ?" and "How can physicists/chemists help with the development of machine learning ?".  In particular, we will touch on the following topics: 
<ul>
<li>Conceptual connections of machine learning and many-body physics</li>
<li>Machine learning techniques for solving many-body physics/chemistry problems</li>
<li>Statistical and quantum physics perspectives on machine learning</li>
<li>Quantum algorithms and quantum hardwares for machine learning</li>
</ul>
