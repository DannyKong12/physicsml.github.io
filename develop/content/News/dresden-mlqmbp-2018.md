Summary: mpipks Dresden hosts the  workshop Machine Learning for Quantum Many-Body Physics (June 25-29, 2018)

The **Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems** in **Dresden** hosts ["Machine Learning for Quantum Many-Body Physics"](https://www.pks.mpg.de/mlq18/) on June 25-29 (2018) - an international workshop on the emerging research area that applies machine learning techniques to problems in quantum many-body physics.

Topics include:

- Supervised phase classification
- Unsupervised learning of quantum phases
- Restricted Boltzmann machines for representing wavefunctions
- Solving quantum many-body problems
- Connections between the renormalization group and deep learning
- Machine learning and density functional theory
- Material discovery using machine learning
- Quantum neural networks
- Quantum error correction and decoding with neural networks
- Quantum state tomography with machine learning
