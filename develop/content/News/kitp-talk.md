Summary: Roger Melko presented an introduction to machine learning for a physics audience at the KITP in Santa Barbara.

With the huge growth of interest in machine learning in the private sector and across 
academia, plus the apparent connections between machine learning and statistical physics,
it was only a matter of time before physicists started exploring the uses of machine
learning for their own work. Recently there has been an explosion of machine learning 
papers appearing on the cond-mat (condensed matter) section of the arxiv (see our 
<a href="pages/papers.html">list of these papers</a>).

Roger Melko explained the basics of machine learning and some of his group's work 
to attendees of the "Synthetic Quantum Matter" program at the KITP in Santa Barbara.
