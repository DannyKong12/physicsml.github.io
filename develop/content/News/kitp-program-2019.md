Summary: KITP Santa Barbara announces a program on Machine Learning for Quantum Many-Body Physics (January 28 - March 22, 2019)

The **Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics** in **Santa Barbara** announces the program ["Machine Learning for Quantum Many-Body Physics"](https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/activities/machine19) to be held form January 28 through March 22, 2019.

It will bring together experts from both physics and computer science to discuss the uses of machine learning in theoretical and experimental many-body physics. Machine learning will be explored as a complementary method to current computational techniques, including Monte Carlo and tensor networks, as well as a method to analyze "big data" generated in experiment.

Topics include:

- the use of neural networks for the purposes of decoding, quantum error correction, and tomography
- theoretical connections between deep learning, the renormalization group, and tensor networks
- foundational questions in machine learning, such as the formal concepts on information, intelligence, and interpretability
- the theoretical possibility of a quantum advantage for machine learning applications implemented on near-term quantum hardware, such as quantum annealers
