## Applying Machine Learning to Physics


- ["Parameter diagnostics of phases and phase transition learning by neural
  networks"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09876v1
"We present an analysis of neural network-based machine learning schemes for
phases and phase transitions in theoretical condensed matter research, focusing
on neural networks with a single hidden layer. Such shallow neural networks
were previously found to be efficient in classifying phases and locating phase
transitions of various basic model systems. In order to rationalize the
emergence of the classification process and for identifying any underlying
physical quantities, it is feasible to examine the weight matrices and the
convolutional filter kernels that result from the learning process of such
shallow networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the learning-by-confusing
scheme can be used, in combination with a simple threshold-value classification
method, to diagnose the learning parameters of neural networks. In particular,
we study the classification process of both fully-connected and convolutional
neural networks for the two-dimensional Ising model with extended domain wall
configurations included in the low-temperature regime. Moreover, we consider
the two-dimensional XY model and contrast the performance of the
learning-by-confusing scheme and convolutional neural networks trained on bare
spin configurations to the case of preprocessed samples with respect to vortex
configurations. We discuss these findings in relation to similar recent
investigations and possible further applications."),

- ["Advantages of versatile neural-network decoding for topological codes"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08680v1
"Finding optimal correction of errors in generic stabilizer codes is a
computationally hard problem, even for simple noise models. While this task can
be simplified for codes with some structure, such as topological stabilizer
codes, developing good and efficient decoders still remains a challenge. In our
work, we systematically study a very versatile class of decoders based on
feedforward neural networks. To demonstrate adaptability, we apply neural
decoders to the triangular color and toric codes under various noise models
with realistic features, such as spatially-correlated errors. We report that
neural decoders provide significant improvement over leading efficient decoders
in terms of the error-correction threshold. Using neural networks simplifies
the process of designing well-performing decoders, and does not require prior
knowledge of the underlying noise model."),

- ["Reinforcement Learning with Neural Networks for Quantum Feedback"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05267v1
"Artificial neural networks are revolutionizing science. While the most
prevalent technique involves supervised training on queries with a known
correct answer, more advanced challenges often require discovering answers
autonomously. In reinforcement learning, control strategies are improved
according to a reward function. The power of this approach has been highlighted
by spectactular recent successes, such as playing Go. So far, it has remained
an open question whether neural-network-based reinforcement learning can be
successfully applied in physics. Here, we show how to use this method for
finding quantum feedback schemes, where a network-based "agent" interacts with
and occasionally decides to measure a quantum system. We illustrate the utility
by finding gate sequences that preserve the quantum information stored in a
small collection of qubits against noise. This specific application will help
to find hardware-adapted feedback schemes for small quantum modules while
demonstrating more generally the promise of neural-network based reinforcement
learning in physics."),

- ["Online Learning of Quantum States"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.09025v1
"Suppose we have many copies of an unknown $n$-qubit state $\rho$. We measure
some copies of $\rho$ using a known two-outcome measurement $E_{1}$, then other
copies using a measurement $E_{2}$, and so on. At each stage $t$, we generate a
current hypothesis $\sigma_{t}$ about the state $\rho$, using the outcomes of
the previous measurements. We show that it is possible to do this in a way that
guarantees that $|\operatorname{Tr}(E_{i} \sigma_{t}) -
\operatorname{Tr}(E_{i}\rho) |$, the error in our prediction for the next
measurement, is at least $\varepsilon$ at most $\operatorname{O}\!\left(n /
\varepsilon^2 \right) $ times. Even in the "non-realizable" setting---where
there could be arbitrary noise in the measurement outcomes---we show how to
output hypothesis states that do significantly worse than the best possible
states at most $\operatorname{O}\!\left(\sqrt {Tn}\right) $ times on the first
$T$ measurements. These results generalize a 2007 theorem by Aaronson on the
PAC-learnability of quantum states, to the online and regret-minimization
settings. We give three different ways to prove our results---using convex
optimization, quantum postselection, and sequential fat-shattering
dimension---which have different advantages in terms of parameters and
portability."),

- ["Deep neural decoders for near term fault-tolerant experiments"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06441v1
"Finding efficient decoders for quantum error correcting codes adapted to
realistic experimental noise in fault-tolerant devices represents a significant
challenge. In this paper we introduce several decoding algorithms complemented
by deep neural decoders and apply them to analyze several fault-tolerant error
correction protocols such as the surface code as well as Steane and Knill error
correction. Our methods require no knowledge of the underlying noise model
afflicting the quantum device making them appealing for real-world experiments.
Our analysis is based on a full circuit-level noise model. It considers both
distance-three and five codes, and is performed near the codes pseudo-threshold
regime. Training deep neural decoders in low noise rate regimes appears to be a
challenging machine learning endeavour. We provide a detailed description of
our neural network architectures and training methodology. We then discuss both
the advantages and limitations of deep neural decoders. Lastly, we provide a
rigorous analysis of the decoding runtime of trained deep neural decoders and
compare our methods with anticipated gate times in future quantum devices.
Given the broad applications of our decoding schemes, we believe that the
methods presented in this paper could have practical applications for near term
fault-tolerant experiments."),

- ["Neural Network Renormalization Group"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02840v1
"We present a variational renormalization group approach using deep generative
model composed of bijectors. The model can learn hierarchical transformations
between physical variables and renormalized collective variables. It can
directly generate statistically independent physical configurations by
iterative refinement at various length scales. The generative model has an
exact and tractable likelihood, which provides renormalized energy function of
the collective variables and supports unbiased rejection sampling of the
physical variables. To train the neural network, we employ probability density
distillation, in which the training loss is a variational upper bound of the
physical free energy. The approach could be useful for automatically
identifying collective variables and effective field theories."),

- ["Deep UQ: Learning deep neural network surrogate models for high
  dimensional uncertainty quantification"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00850v1
"State-of-the-art computer codes for simulating real physical systems are
often characterized by a vast number of input parameters. Performing
uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks with Monte Carlo (MC) methods is almost
always infeasible because of the need to perform hundreds of thousands or even
millions of forward model evaluations in order to obtain convergent statistics.
One, thus, tries to construct a cheap-to-evaluate surrogate model to replace
the forward model solver. For systems with large numbers of input parameters,
one has to deal with the curse of dimensionality - the exponential increase in
the volume of the input space, as the number of parameters increases linearly.
In this work, we demonstrate the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to construct
surrogate models for numerical simulators. We parameterize the structure of the
DNN in a manner that lends the DNN surrogate the interpretation of recovering a
low dimensional nonlinear manifold. The model response is a parameterized
nonlinear function of the low dimensional projections of the input. We think of
this low dimensional manifold as a nonlinear generalization of the notion of
the active subspace. Our approach is demonstrated with a problem on uncertainty
propagation in a stochastic elliptic partial differential equation (SPDE) with
uncertain diffusion coefficient. We deviate from traditional formulations of
the SPDE problem by not imposing a specific covariance structure on the random
diffusion coefficient. Instead, we attempt to solve a more challenging problem
of learning a map between an arbitrary snapshot of the diffusion field and the
response."),

- ["Experimentally detecting a quantum change point via Bayesian inference"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07508v1
"Detecting a change point is a crucial task in statistics that has been
recently extended to the quantum realm. A source state generator that emits a
series of single photons in a default state suffers an alteration at some point
and starts to emit photons in a mutated state. The problem consists in
identifying the point where the change took place. In this work, we consider a
learning agent that applies Bayesian inference on experimental data to solve
this problem. This learning machine adjusts the measurement over each photon
according to the past experimental results finds the change position in an
online fashion. Our results show that the local-detection success probability
can be largely improved by using such a machine learning technique. This
protocol provides a tool for improvement in many applications where a sequence
of identical quantum states is required."),

"The difficulty of validating large-scale quantum devices, such as Boson
Samplers, poses a major challenge for any research program that aims to show
quantum advantages over classical hardware. To address this problem, we propose
a novel data-driven approach wherein models are trained to identify common
pathologies using unsupervised machine learning methods. We illustrate this
idea by training a classifier that exploits K-means clustering to distinguish
between Boson Samplers that use indistinguishable photons from those that do
not. We train the model on numerical simulations of small-scale Boson Samplers
and then validate the pattern recognition technique on larger numerical
simulations as well as on photonic chips in both traditional Boson Sampling and
scattershot experiments. The effectiveness of such method relies on
particle-type-dependent internal correlations present in the output
distributions. This approach performs substantially better on the test data
than previous methods and underscores the ability to further generalize its
operation beyond the scope of the examples that it was trained on."),

"In this paper we propose new algorithm to reduce autocorrelation in Markov
chain Monte-Carlo algorithms for euclidean field theories on the lattice. Our
proposing algorithm is the Hybrid Monte-Carlo algorithm (HMC) with restricted
Boltzmann machine. We examine the validity of the algorithm by employing the
phi-fourth theory in three dimension. We observe reduction of the
autocorrelation both in symmetric and broken phase as well. Our proposing
algorithm provides consistent central values of expectation values of the
action density and one-point Green's function with ones from the original HMC
in both the symmetric phase and broken phase within the statistical error. On
the other hand, two-point Green's functions have slight difference between one
calculated by the HMC and one by our proposing algorithm in the symmetric
phase. Furthermore, near the criticality, the distribution of the one-point
Green's function differs from the one from HMC. We discuss the origin of
discrepancies and its improvement."),

"We detect the quantum phase transition of a quantum many-body system by
mapping the observed results of the quantum state onto a neural network. In the
present study, we utilized the simplest case of a quantum many-body system,
namely a one-dimensional chain of Ising spins with the transverse Ising model.
We prepared several spin configurations, which were obtained using repeated
observations of the model for a particular strength of the transverse field, as
input data for the neural network. Although the proposed method can be employed
using experimental observations of quantum many-body systems, we tested our
technique with spin configurations generated by a quantum Monte Carlo
simulation without initial relaxation. The neural network successfully
classified the strength of transverse field only from the spin configurations,
leading to consistent estimations of the critical point of our model $\Gamma_c
=J$."),

http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.00127v1
"The number of parameters describing a quantum state is well known to grow
exponentially with the number of particles. This scaling clearly limits our
ability to do tomography to systems with no more than a few qubits and has been
used to argue against the universal validity of quantum mechanics itself.
However, from a computational learning theory perspective, it can be shown
that, in a probabilistic setting, quantum states can be approximately learned
using only a linear number of measurements. Here we experimentally demonstrate
this linear scaling in optical systems with up to 6 qubits. Our results
highlight the power of computational learning theory to investigate quantum
information, provide the first experimental demonstration that quantum states
can be "probably approximately learned" with access to a number of copies of
the state that scales linearly with the number of qubits, and pave the way to
probing quantum states at new, larger scales."),

"Neural network based machine learning is emerging as a powerful tool for
obtaining phase diagrams when traditional regression schemes using local
equilibrium order parameters are not available, as in many-body localized or
topological phases. Nevertheless, instances of machine learning offering new
insights have been rare up to now. Here we show that a single feed-forward
neural network can decode the defining structures of two distinct MBL phases
and a thermalizing phase, using entanglement spectra obtained from individual
eigenstates. For this, we introduce a simplicial geometry based method for
extracting multi-partite phase boundaries. We find that this method outperforms
conventional metrics (like the entanglement entropy) for identifying MBL phase
transitions, revealing a sharper phase boundary and shedding new insight into
the topology of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the phase diagram we acquire
from a single disorder configuration confirms that the machine-learning based
approach we establish here can enable speedy exploration of large phase spaces
that can assist with the discovery of new MBL phases. To our knowledge this
work represents the first example of a machine learning approach revealing new
information beyond conventional knowledge."),

- ["Learning hard quantum distributions with variational autoencoders"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1710.00725v1
"Studying general quantum many-body systems is one of the major challenges in
modern physics because it requires an amount of computational resources that
scales exponentially with the size of the system.Simulating the evolution of a
state, or even storing its description, rapidly becomes intractable for exact
classical algorithms. Recently, machine learning techniques, in the form of
restricted Boltzmann machines, have been proposed as a way to efficiently
represent certain quantum states with applications in state tomography and
ground state estimation. Here, we introduce a new representation of states
based on variational autoencoders. Variational autoencoders are a type of
generative model in the form of a neural network. We probe the power of this
representation by encoding probability distributions associated with states
from different classes. Our simulations show that deep networks give a better
representation for states that are hard to sample from, while providing no
benefit for random states. This suggests that the probability distributions
associated to hard quantum states might have a compositional structure that can
be exploited by layered neural networks. Specifically, we consider the
learnability of a class of quantum states introduced by Fefferman and Umans.
Such states are provably hard to sample for classical computers, but not for
quantum ones, under plausible computational complexity assumptions. The good
level of compression achieved for hard states suggests these methods can be
suitable for characterising states of the size expected in first generation
quantum hardware."),

"Our understanding of supercooled liquids and glasses has lagged significantly
behind that of simple liquids and crystalline solids. This is in part due to
the many possibly relevant degrees of freedom that are present due to the
disorder inherent to these systems and in part to non-equilibrium effects which
are difficult to treat in the standard context of statistical physics. Together
these issues have resulted in a field whose theories are under-constrained by
experiment and where fundamental questions are still unresolved. Mean field
results have been successful in infinite dimensions but it is unclear to what
extent they apply to realistic systems and assume uniform local structure. At
odds with this are theories premised on the existence of structural defects.
However, until recently it has been impossible to find structural signatures
that are predictive of dynamics. Here we summarize and recast the results from
several recent papers offering a data driven approach to building a
phenomenological theory of disordered materials by combining machine learning
with physical intuition."),

"Last year, at least 30,000 scientific papers used the Kohn-Sham scheme of
density functional theory to solve electronic structure problems in a wide
variety of scientific fields, ranging from materials science to biochemistry to
astrophysics. Machine learning holds the promise of learning the kinetic energy
functional via examples, by-passing the need to solve the Kohn-Sham equations.
This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing either larger
systems or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this
functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present
work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and
energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. Both improved
accuracy and lower computational cost with this method are demonstrated by
reproducing DFT energies for a range of molecular geometries generated during
molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, the methodology could be applied
directly to quantum chemical calculations, allowing construction of density
functionals of quantum-chemical accuracy."),

"In this letter, we apply the artificial neural network in a supervised manner
to map out the quantum phase diagram of disordered topological superconductor
in class DIII. Given the disorder that keeps the discrete symmetries of the
ensemble as a whole, translational symmetry which is broken in the
quasiparticle distribution individually is recovered statistically by taking an
ensemble average. By using this, we classify the phases by the artificial
neural network that learned the quasiparticle distribution in the clean limit,
and show that the result is totally consistent with the calculation by the
transfer matrix method or noncommutative geometry approach. If all three
phases, namely the $\mathbb{Z}_2$, trivial, and the thermal metal phases appear
in the clean limit, the machine can classify them with high confidence over the
entire phase diagram. If only the former two phases are present, we find that
the machine remains confused in the certain region, leading us to conclude the
detection of the unknown phase which is eventually identified as the thermal
metal phase. In our method, only the first moment of the quasiparticle
distribution is used for input, but application to a wider variety of systems
is expected by the inclusion of higher moments."),

"Quantum information technologies, and intelligent learning systems, are both
emergent technologies that will likely have a transforming impact on our
society. The respective underlying fields of research -- quantum information
(QI) versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) -- have
their own specific challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely
independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been
probing the question to what extent these fields can learn and benefit from
each other. QML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML,
investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve
the problems of the other. Recently, we have witnessed breakthroughs in both
directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital
application in providing speed-ups in ML, critical in our "big data" world.
Conversely, ML already permeates cutting-edge technologies, and may become
instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in
data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments,
quantum enhancements have also been demonstrated for interactive learning,
highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works
exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments, and for
performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first
successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement, researchers have also
broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of ML/AI concepts.

"Motivated by the close relations of the renormalization group with both the

geometry can emerge from deep learning the entanglement feature of a quantum
many-body state. We develop a concrete algorithm, call the entanglement feature
learning (EFL), based on the random tensor network (RTN) model for the tensor
network holography. We show that each RTN can be mapped to a Boltzmann machine,
trained by the entanglement entropies over all subregions of a given quantum
many-body state. The goal is to construct the optimal RTN that best reproduce
the entanglement feature. The RTN geometry can then be interpreted as the
emergent holographic geometry. We demonstrate the EFL algorithm on 1D free
fermion system and observe the emergence of the hyperbolic geometry (AdS$_3$
spatial geometry) as we tune the fermion system towards the gapless critical
point (CFT$_2$ point)."),

neural network can capture the global and nonlinear topological features of
quantum phases from local inputs. By opening up the neural network, we confirm
that the network does learn the discrete version of the winding number formula.

physics, while there has been recent interest in representing physical data

natural question to ask is whether deep neural networks hold any advantage over
shallow networks in representing such data. We investigate this question by
using unsupervised, generative graphical models to learn the probability
distribution of a two-dimensional Ising system. Deep Boltzmann machines, deep
belief networks, and deep restricted Boltzmann networks are trained on thermal
spin configurations from this system, and compared to the shallow architecture
of the restricted Boltzmann machine. We benchmark the models, focussing on the
accuracy of generating energetic observables near the phase transition, where
these quantities are most difficult to approximate. Interestingly, after
training the generative networks, we observe that the accuracy essentially
depends only on the number of neurons in the first hidden layer of the network,

evidence that shallow networks are more efficient than deep networks at

artificial neural-network states is recently becoming highly desirable in the
applications of machine learning techniques to quantum many-body physics. Here,
we study the quantum entanglement properties of neural-network states, with a
focus on the restricted-Boltzmann-machine (RBM) architecture. We prove that the
entanglement of all short-range RBM states satisfies an area law for arbitrary
dimensions and bipartition geometry. For long-range RBM states we show by using
an exact construction that such states could exhibit volume-law entanglement,
implying a notable capability of RBM in representing efficiently quantum states
with massive entanglement. We further examine generic RBM states with random
weight parameters. We find that their averaged entanglement entropy obeys
volume-law scaling and meantime strongly deviates from the Page-entropy of the
completely random pure states. We show that their entanglement spectrum has no
universal part associated with random matrix theory and bears a Poisson-type
level statistics. Using reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that RBM is
capable of finding the ground state (with power-law entanglement) of a model
Hamiltonian with long-range interaction. In addition, we show, through a
concrete example of the one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological cluster

the aforementioned ensemble average and involving explicitly order parameters
obtained from the thermodynamic analysis. This accounts in particular for the
dominant singular values evolution and how this is driven by the input data: in
the linear regime at the beginning of the learning, they correspond to unstable
deformation modes of W reflecting dominant covariance modes of the data. In the
non-linear regime it is seen how the selected modes interact in later stages of
the learning procedure, by eventually imposing a matching between order
parameters with their empirical counterparts estimated from the data.
Experiments on both artificial and real data illustrate these considerations,
showing in particular how the RBM operates in the ferromagnetic compositional

a deep mathematical connection between image classification problem and quantum

that there is a sub-volume-law bound for entanglement entropy of target
functions of reasonable image classification problems. Therefore target
functions of image classification only occupy a small subspace of the whole
Hilbert space. As a result, a neural network with polynomial number of
parameters is efficient for representation of such target functions of image.
The concept of entanglement entropy can also be useful to characterize the
expressive power of different neural networks. For example, we show that to
maintain the same expressive power, number of channels $D$ in a convolutional

Specifically, we show an equivalence between the function realized by a deep

  Learning"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3831v1
"Deep learning is a broad set of techniques that uses multiple layers of
representation to automatically learn relevant features directly from
structured data. Recently, such techniques have yielded record-breaking results
on a diverse set of difficult machine learning tasks in computer vision, speech
recognition, and natural language processing. Despite the enormous success of
deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these
techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show
that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and
successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG).
RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of
relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at
different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational
renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning
architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate
these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions.
Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a
generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data."),

## Quantum Computation and Quantum Algorithms for Machine Learning

  learning"](
http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05340v1
"Machine learning employs dynamical algorithms that mimic the human capacity
to learn, where the reinforcement learning ones are among the most similar to
humans in this respect. On the other hand, adaptability is an essential aspect
to perform any task efficiently in a changing environment, and it is
fundamental for many purposes, such as natural selection. Here, we propose an
algorithm based on successive measurements to adapt one quantum state to a
reference unknown state, in the sense of achieving maximum overlap. The
protocol naturally provides many identical copies of the reference state, such
that in each measurement iteration more information about it is obtained. In
our protocol, we consider a system composed of three parts, the "environment"
system, which provides the reference state copies; the register, which is an
auxiliary subsystem that interacts with the environment to acquire information
from it; and the agent, which corresponds to the quantum state that is adapted
by digital feedback with input corresponding to the outcome of the measurements
on the register. With this proposal we can achieve an average fidelity between
the environment and the agent of more than $90\% $ with less than $30$
iterations of the protocol. In addition, we extend the formalism to $ d
$-dimensional states, reaching an average fidelity of around $80\% $ in less
than $400$ iterations for $d=$ 11, for a variety of genuinely quantum as well
as semiclassical states. This work paves the way for the development of quantum
reinforcement learning protocols using quantum data, and the future deployment
of semi-autonomous quantum systems."),

"Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models with the

variational autoencoder} (QVAE): a VAE whose latent generative process is
implemented as a quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM). We show that our model can be
trained end-to-end by maximizing a well-defined loss-function: a "quantum"
lower-bound to a variational approximation of the log-likelihood. We use
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to train and evaluate the performance of
QVAEs. To achieve the best performance, we first create a VAE platform with
discrete latent space generated by a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST dataset when compared
against similar approaches that only involve discrete variables in the
generative process. We consider QVAEs with a smaller number of latent units to
be able to perform QMC simulations, which are computationally expensive. We
show that QVAEs can be trained effectively in regimes where quantum effects are
relevant despite training via the quantum bound. Our findings open the way to
the use of quantum computers to train QVAEs to achieve competitive performance
for generative models. Placing a QBM in the latent space of a VAE leverages the
full potential of current and next-generation quantum computers as sampling
devices."),

technologies will help or hinder the security of machine learning. Here we
discuss a number of ways that quantum information can be used to help make
quantum classifiers more secure or private. In particular, we demonstrate a
form of robust principal component analysis that, under some circumstances, can
provide an exponential speedup relative to robust methods used at present. To
demonstrate this approach we introduce a linear combinations of unitaries
Hamiltonian simulation method that we show functions when given an imprecise
Hamiltonian oracle, which may be of independent interest. We also introduce a
new quantum approach for bagging and boosting that can use quantum
superposition over the classifiers or splits of the training set to aggregate
over many more models than would be possible classically. Finally, we provide a
private form of $k$--means clustering that can be used to prevent an all
powerful adversary from learning more than a small fraction of a bit from any

security of ML and vice versa. This illustrates that quantum computing can

number of quantum black-box queries which are required to exactly identify an
unknown function from C is $O(\frac{\log |C|}{\sqrt{{\hat{\gamma}}^{C}}})$,
where $\hat{\gamma}^{C}$ is a combinatorial parameter of the class C. We
essentially resolve this conjecture in the affirmative by giving a quantum
algorithm that, for any class C, identifies any unknown function from C using
$O(\frac{\log |C| \log \log |C|}{\sqrt{{\hat{\gamma}}^{C}}})$ quantum black-box
queries.
  We consider a range of natural problems intermediate between the exact
learning problem (in which the learner must obtain all bits of information
about the black-box function) and the usual problem of computing a predicate
(in which the learner must obtain only one bit of information about the
black-box function). We give positive and negative results on when the quantum
